          My favorite drink is coffee. It's the aroma that I wake up to each
          morning, a friendly pick-me-up that helps kickstart my day. Its rich
          flavor and warmth provide a sense of comfort and routine. Whether it's
          served piping hot in a mug, or ice-cold in a glass, coffee is more
          than just a beverage to me. It's a moment of solace in a busy day, a
          shared joy with friends, and an energizer for those late-night
          brainstorming sessions. Simply put, my day isn't complete without a
          cup of coffee.
