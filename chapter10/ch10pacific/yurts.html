            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
              A yurt is a round, portable dwelling that has been used by nomadic
              cultures of Central Asia for over three thousand years. These
              structures are known for their durability, comfort, and ability to
              be easily disassembled and transported.
